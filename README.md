# Getting Started

## Available Scrips

In the project directory, you should run:

### `git clone https://github.com/not-lonwabo/sentence-builder-backend.git`

This will clone the backend repo for you to be able to run the api.
Once this completes run:

### `git clone https://github.com/not-lonwabo/sentence-builder-frontend.git`

This will clone your front-end repo.

### `docker-compose up`

This is to bring both the front-end and back-end up, and once this is running you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 on your browser to test the app.
